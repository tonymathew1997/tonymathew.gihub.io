            <p>I am a guy who likes to make others happy and to make them happier. I was a student who came to Canada to fulfil his own dreams. I am completing a course in Information Technology and Business Analysis Operations in Conestoga, which allows me to know what the current needs of the business sector are. Technology and creativity are constantly on my mind, which influences me to choose this direction as my profession. I consider myself a student forever to learn more skills and experience in the field of work.</p>
            <p>I am very open minded and always loves to work with people. Communication is the easiest way to build relationships and it is one of my strengths. I can interact effectively with everyone. For me thinking out of the box for solutions stand out in the crowd.  Apart from the career path my hobbies are cooking, travelling and music. The short or long travels are the best way to relax from all the stress and refresh yourself which I have been doing for a long time.</p>
            <p>For a good start of my career I am looking for a company with a good working environment and strong policies. I work hard for the goal and always take challenges as an opportunity to grow and enhance my skills. The good kick start of the career and building it in an organized way to reach the top is the next step. “Pre plan”, “work hard” and “focus” are the three words which I follow to achieve success.</p>
